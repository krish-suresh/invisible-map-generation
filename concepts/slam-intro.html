        <p>
            SLAM stands for “Simultaneous Localization and Mapping”, and is a general class of problems especially
            prevalent in robotics. It involves recording measurements from various sensors (Visual Inertial
            Odometry (VIO), <a href="https://april.eecs.umich.edu/software/apriltag.html" target="_blank">April Tag
            </a> detection, LIDAR, etc.) to create a map of some space, and your location within it (hence,
            localization and mapping). This has many applications, especially in autonomous navigation for robots.
            Invisible Map encounters this problem when a user is creating a new map. The goal of the project is to
            use the data from the phone's odometry and the April tag detections to generate a map of a space using
            a SLAM algorithm called G2O.
