        <h2 id="slam-intro">The Problem: SLAM</h2>
        <p>
            SLAM stands for “Simultaneous Localization and Mapping”, and is a general class of problems especially
            prevalent in robotics. It involves recording measurements from various sensors (Visual Inertial
            Odometry (VIO), <a href="https://april.eecs.umich.edu/software/apriltag.html">April Tag</a> detection,
            LIDAR, etc.) to create a map of some space, and your location within it (hence, localization and
            mapping). This has many applications, especially in autonomous navigation for robots. Invisible Map
            encounters this problem when a user is creating a new map.
        </p>

        <h2 id="graphs-intro">The Model: Introduction to Graphs</h2>
        <p>
            Most SLAM solutions represent sensor data as a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)">graph</a>. The main vertices
            (nodes) that appear in graph-based SLAM are the camera poses and sometimes landmarks, and the edges
            between vertices are constraints (some physical relationship). In the Invisible Map, the nodes are
            camera poses, April tag poses, and dummy nodes (explained further in --SECTION--). The edges are the
            VIO and tag detection data gathered during map creation.
        </p>

        <h2 id="g2o-intro">The Solution: G2O</h2>
        <p>
            G2O, or “generic graph optimization”, is <a href="https://www.cct.lsu.edu/~kzhang/papers/g2o.pdf">an
            algorithm to solve SLAM problems</a> first proposed in 2011, and is now pretty standard. G2O, like
            most other SLAM solutions, represents measurements as a graph. Each vertex contains a pose - some
            position and orientation, either represented as a vector of 3
            position elements followed by 3 (or 4) orientation elements, or some 4x4 matrix representing a rotation
            and a translation. One can easily be translated to the other. The edges each have some linear
            transformation representing the conversion from one vertex to the next.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most important intuition to get first is that the edge values (the measurements) are fixed, while
            the vertex values (the poses) are variable. G2O will not change the measurements, instead altering the
            poses to best match them. To do this, G2O defines an error function, F(X), and attempts to minimize it.
