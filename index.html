            Welcome OCCAM Lab Invisible Map Developers! This website explains the base knowledge for you to start
            working on the Invisible Map project as well as links to more detailed resources.
        </p>


        <h2 id="intro">Project Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The Invisible Map is an <a href="https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/" target="_blank">
            iOS ARKit</a> project developed in the OCCAM lab at Olin College of Engineering.
            It is aimed at assisting people who are blind or visually impaired in navigating unfamiliar spaces,
            however it is applicable to situations where any person may be able to utilize it, such as hospitals,
            conventions, stadiums, and other large indoor spaces. The goal of the project is for a user to be able
            to map out a space by placing <a href="https://april.eecs.umich.edu/software/apriltag.html" target=
            "_blank">AprilTags</a> around the area and using iPhone AR capabilites to record data and mark points
            of interest as they walk paths through the space. Then, the map can be used in AR by people unfamiliar
            with the space to navigate between locations.
        </p>
        <h3 id="structure-intro">Code Structure</h3>
        <p>
            Currently, the code consists of three main parts: the front-end map creation (Invisible Map Creator),
            the back-end map processing, and the front-end map viewing (Invisible Map). The code for the front-end
            parts are in the <a href="https://github.com/occamLab/InvisibleMap">InvisibleMap repository on
            Github</a>, and the code for the back-end is in the
            <a href="https://github.com/occamLab/invisible-map-generation">invisible-map-generation repository</a>.
        </p>
        <h4 id="map-creator">Invisible Map Creator</h4>
        <p>
            InvisibleMapCreator is an iOS app written in Swift and using
            <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/" target="_blank">SwiftUI</a> and ARKit.
            The most recent version of the map creator is in the InvisibleMapCreator2 folder of the master branch
            of the InvisibleMap repository. The floor-detection branch of this repository also contains an updated
            version of the structure of the data collected and includes gathering extra data about the planes
            detected by ARKit. 
        </p>
        <p>
            InvisibleMapCreator2 is a restructuring and redesign of the original
            InvisibleMapCreator app. Marion and Avery describe the code structure in
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13iVLu6OGieQ8GTn1ysAw7daawXYnD5HghI6UZjw1c9s/edit?usp=sharing"
            target="_blank">their write-up of their work</a> and also
            link to more detailed resources to understand the architecture. In summary, the app utilizes a 
            composable finite state machine, which tracks the different UIs (views) of the app. The state machine
            responds to <b>events</b> which are usually triggered by some user input or action, and can 
            <b>transition</b> between states or emit a <b>command</b> in response to an events. The commands are 
            used to communicate with the main functional components of the app (such as gathering data points).
            The map creator uploads the data to <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" target="_blank">
            Firebase</a>, which hosts the Invisible Map's data.
        </p>
        <p>
            The InvisibleMapCreator detects AprilTags as the user walks and also allows the user to save locations
            at any points of interest they choose.
        </p>
        <h4 id="back-end">Map Processing (Otimization)</h4>
        <p>
            The back-end map processing code is written in Python and must be run from a Linux machine.
            The most recent version of the processing code is in the duncan-work-branch branch of the
            invisible-map-generation repository. The README contains instructions on installing and running
            the code and its dependencies. The back-end imports the raw map data from Firebase, runs it through
            the G2O algorithm to optimize the map (phone positions and tag positions), and uploads the optimized map
            to Firebase for the Invisible Map app to access.
        </p>
        <h4 id="map-viewer">Invisible Map</h4>
        <p>
            Invisible Map is an app written in Swift and C++ and using
            <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit">UIKit</a> and ARKit.
            The most recent version of the code is in the master branch of the InvisibleMap repository. This app
            pulls the optimized map data from Firebase, and allows the user to pick a map and navigate around
            a space. The app will show predicted locations of the AprilTags as well as any saved locations as the
            user walks around.
