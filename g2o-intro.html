        <h1>The Solution: G2O</h1>
        <p>
            G2O, or “generic graph optimization”, is <a href="https://www.cct.lsu.edu/~kzhang/papers/g2o.pdf"
            target="_blank">an algorithm to solve SLAM problems</a> first proposed in 2011, and is now pretty
            standard. G2O, like most other SLAM solutions, represents measurements as a graph. Each vertex
            contains a pose - some position and orientation, either represented as a vector of 3
            position elements followed by 3 (or 4) orientation elements, or some 4x4 matrix representing a rotation
            and a translation. One can easily be translated to the other. The edges each have some linear
            transformation representing the conversion from one vertex to the next.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most important intuition to get first is that the edge values (the measurements) are fixed, while
            the vertex values (the poses) are variable. G2O will not change the measurements, instead altering the
            poses to best match them. To do this, G2O defines an error function, F(X), and attempts to minimize it.
